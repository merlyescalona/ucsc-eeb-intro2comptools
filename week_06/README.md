# Week 06: Complex data types, loops, I/O, scripts and more...

## Dictionaries

> Change your flag to yellow ![](img/yellow.jpeg)

Dictionaries are great to store paired data, they are defined with curly brackets:

```
nuc_names= {'a':'adenine','g':'guanine','c':'cytosine','t':'thymine'}
```

In our dictionary the single letters `a g c t` are the keys, while the names `adenine guanine cytosine thymine` are the values

We can access a specific value by:

```
nuc_names['a']
```

Here is an example about how using dictionaries can make our life easier. We want to replace our list with another list with its names.

```
nuc = ['a','g','t','c']
```

We know the element we want to replace:

```
nuc[0]
```

We can manually replace `a` by adenine by:

```
nuc[0] = 'adenine'

nuc
```

It will be inefficient to re-assign every element manually. Instead we can use a loop and the dictionary to do it.

## Loops

Loops are powerful functions that iterate an action over items. We learnt some basic loops for `bash`. 

### `for` loop

We will start with the ***for loop***. These loops are traditionally used when you have a block of code which you want to repeat a fixed number of times. The ***for*** statement iterates over the member of a sequence in order, executing a block of instructions each time.

```
for VARIABLE in ITERABLE_SEQUENCE:
	BLOCK
```

For example,  we can print easily, one by one every element of our list:

```
nuc = ['a','g','t','c']
for item in nuc:
	print(item)

```

Notice that `item` is a variable, an arbitrary name that we assigned to every element in the list. We can replace `item` by whatever and will get the same result. Assigning meaningful names will make our code more readable and understandable:

```
for nucleotide in nuc:
	print(nucleotide)
```

We can now employ our dictionary to replace every element in the list, but how do we access the elements of a dictionary?? Do you remember how we can call function out of variables because they, given the type of data they are, have this property?

Dictionaries have a lot of fuctions, if we want to look for the functions of a variable we can use `help(VARIABLE)`.

```
help(nuc_names)
```
 
The `help()` function, with no argument, it will open an interactive help system on the interpreter console (you can exit with `quit` or <kbd> ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>c</kbd>). If the argument is a string (any word), then the string is looked up as the name of a module, function, class, method, keyword, or documentation topic, and a help page is printed on the console.
 
This will show us all the different functions related to this variable and all the attributes that the variable has.

We can also use the function `dir()`, without arguments, it return the list of names in the current local scope. With an argument, attempt to return a list of valid attributes for that object. I consider this to be a summarized help, it shows you only the names of the attributes and functions without a long exaplanation.


Now that we know some of the functions that the dictionary has, we can work with it and print all the keys:

```
for k in nuc_names.keys():
	print(k)
```

We can also print the values:

```
for v in nuc_names.values():
	print(v)
```

But, we can also print both key and value at the same time:

```
for k, v in nuc_names.items():
	print(v)
```

And, we can even be more literal in our printing:

```
for k, v in nuc_names.items():
    print(k,' is the abbreviation for ',v)
```


Now we can build a loop statement that iterates over our list and dictionary, and modify our list given the information stored in our dictionary:

```
for index in range(0,4):
	nuc_to_replace = nuc[index]
	nuc[index] = nuc_names[nuc_to_replace] 

nuc
```

Great!

### `while` loop

> Change your flag to yellow ![](img/yellow.jpeg)

***while*** loops, like the ***For*** Loop, are used for repeating sections of code - but unlike a ***for*** loop, the while loop will not run n times, but until a defined condition is no longer met. If the condition is initially false, the loop body will not be executed at all.

This is an example when the condition is satisfied:

```
x = 1
while True:
    print("To infinity and beyond! Time: ", x)
    x += 1
```

This is an example when the conition is never satisfied:

```
while False:
    print("To infinity and beyond! Bummer, this will never happen. ")
```

Now, let's try to finish the loop when variable `x` has reached the value 10.

```
x = 1
while x<10:
    print("Until  x is not 10! Right now, x=", x)
    x += 1

x
```

## Scripts

> Change your flag to yellow ![](img/yellow.jpeg)

So far we have been playing around with the interpreter, but we don't want to run long runs of code in the interpreter all the time. Also, with the interactive interpreter session will allow you to write a lot of lines of code, but once you close the session, you lose everything youâ€™ve written. It's tedious and does not make a lot of sense specially if you need to run things several times. To solve this we are going to generate scripts. The usual way of writing Python scripts is by using plain text files. By convention, those files will use the `.py` extension. So, let's start by creating a folder for this week and write our script.

```
mkdir week_06
cd week_06
nano hello.py
```

Once the editor is open write the following code, save it and close the editor:

```python {.line-numbers}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('Hello World!')
```

> ***How does the interpreter run Python scripts?***
> 
> When you try to run Python scripts, a multi-step process begins. In this process the interpreter will:
> 
> 1. Process the statements of your script in a sequential fashion
> 2. Turns each line while its interpreting it into lower-level code so it can be ran
> 3. Runs your instructions in low-level code one by one.

To run the script we will use the `python3` command and press <kbd>Return</kbd>:

```
python3 hello.py
```

## Writing files

> Change your flag to yellow ![](img/yellow.jpeg)

Now,  that we know how to run scripts, let's use all of the content that we have used today to learn how to write and read files by running scripts.

Create a new script with the name  `testwrite.py` and add the following code:

```python {.line-numbers}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('This is my first mid-size Python script')

nuc_names= {'a':'adenine','g':'guanine','c':'cytosine','t':'thymine'}

f = open("nucleotides.txt", "w")

for k, v in nuc_names.items():
	f.write("{} corresponds to {}\n".format(k,v))

f.close()

f = open("numbers.txt", "w")

for num in range(0,10):
	f.write("{}\n".format(num))

f.close()
```

Let's go through the script line by line. We are setting up the variable `nuc_names`, which is a dictionary, with keys being the nucleotides and the values the corresponding nucleotide name.

Then, we are openning the stream of a file with the function `open(filename,mode)`. The mode specifies how to work with the files:

| Character | Meaning															|
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `r`       | ** open for reading (default)										|
| `w`       | ** open for writing, truncating the file first						|
| `x`       | ** create a new file and open it for writing							|
| `a`       | open for writing, appending to the end of the file if it exists	|
| `b`       | binary mode														|
| `t`       | text mode (default)												|
| `+`       | open a disk file for updating (reading and writing)				|
| `U`       | universal newline mode (deprecated)								|


Then, we have the ***for*** loop iterating over the dictionary to get both keys and values, and we want to add this information to a file. 
The function `f.write(content)` will add the content to the file, but the content also has to be a singe string, so we format our string, with our keys, values, the test and the character that represents the new line `\n`. This will then generate a line of content each time. 

And once all the content has been written, we need to let  the system know that we are not going to use that stream anymore, so we close it with `f.close()`.

For the second ***for*** loop, we are just writing numbers from 0 to 10, to a file, each number in a single line. The argument of the function `f.write(content)` has to be a string, so we need to transform our number to a string and in addition we have to add the character that represents the new line `\n`.

We can run the script with:

```
python3 testwrite.py
```

Now, let's check the output files:

```
ls -lh
cat nucleotides.txt
cat numbers.txt
```

## Reading files 

> Change your flag to yellow ![](img/yellow.jpeg)


Now that we know how to write a file, let's read one of the files we generated, create a new script called `testread.py` with the following code:

```python {.line-numbers}
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print('This is my second mid-size Python script')

f = open("numbers.txt", "r")

print("Getting the first line:", f.readline())
print("Getting the rest of the lines:")
for number in f.readlines():
	print("Content of new line: ", int(number))
f.close()
```

Now, let's get over the script. We open the file with the function `open(filename, mode)`, this time with `mode=r` because we want to read the file.  Then we can get the content of a single line of the file with the function `f.readline()`. Then we can get all the lines of a file with the function `f.readlines()`. This function will return a list of strings, where each string is a line of the file. We now iterate over that list, like we did with the `nuc` variable before, and print the content of each element of the list. Since we had to add that `\n` (new line character) the output will be a little weird, so we will get that value to be considered as an integer with the function `int()` and we will have a nice list of numbers. Check the result by runnning the script with:

```
python3 testread.py
```
