# Workshop on basic programming skills for biologists / Introduction to computational tools

The aim of the workshop is to provide the attendants with the jump-start skills necessary to begin using the command line, supercomputers, and the python programing language. 

This course is going to be hands-on starting from the basics. We expect every assistant to bring their laptops, and we will go over exercises during class.

If you are a student, enrolling in the seminar is encouraged but not necessary (number 44893). The course is open now.

## When and where?

Winter Quarter 2020.

Starting January 10th, 2020, we will meet Fridays from 2:00-3:00pm (room is booked until 3:30pm just in case) at CBB 110.

Also available via Zoom: https://ucsc.zoom.us/j/362270298?_ga=2.164099577.715449705.1578525081-1039659721.1578525081

Meeting ID: 362-270-298

## What to expect?

At the end of the course participants will be comfortable using the bash environment, submitting jobs to the hummingbird supercomputer, and writing basic python scripts.

To pass the course students formally enrrolled are expected to attend at least 70% of the classes and develop a coding project that will be presented in the last class, the project can be developed alone or with a classmate.

W-10 Studentsâ€™ project presentations

## Project requirements

- Work individually or with one classmate.
- Write a python script that solves a problem within your research. Alternatively you can write a python script about a game or something you are passionated about.
- Upload the code to github and write a readme.md file.
- Prepare for a small demostration of the code in the final class.
