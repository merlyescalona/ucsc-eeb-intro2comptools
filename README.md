# Workshop on basic programming skills for biologists / Introduction to computational tools

The aim of the workshop is to provide the attendants with the jump-start skills necessary to begin using the command line, supercomputers, and the python programing language. 

This course is going to be hands-on starting from the basics. We expect every assistant to bring their laptops, and we will go over exercises during class.

If you are a student, enrolling in the seminar is encouraged but not necessary (number 44893). The course is open now.

## When and where?

Winter Quarter 2020.

Starting January 10th, 2020, we will meet Fridays from 2:00-3:00pm (room is booked until 3:30pm just in case) at CBB 110.
