# Workshop on basic programming skills for biologists / Introduction to computational tools

The aim of the workshop is to provide the attendants with the jump-start skills necessary to begin using the command line, supercomputers, and the python programing language. 

We will meet weekly for one hour and 20 min.

## What to expect:
At the end of the course participants will be comfortable using the bash environment, submitting jobs to the hummingbird supercomputer, and writing basic python scripts.

## Weekly program (subject to change):

- Setting resources necessary, introduction to the bash environment, navigating your computer using bash
- Text editors, basic bash scripts, bash loops
- Introduction to version control, GitHub, Bitbucket
- Connecting to hummingbird, copying data, and submitting jobs
- Introduction to python, main elements in python. Lists, float vs. integers etc
- Loops in python
- Manipulating data frames in python, pandas
- Biopython
- Complex scripts in python, processing multiple files using loops. General tips for coding
