You should have access to the linux environment, running virtual box if you have a windows machine or native in your mac.

**Open terminal**
Also called command line, this is an application:
Mac: applications > utilities > Terminal.app
Ubuntu: 

You might want to add this applciation to your dock for rapid access

**Navigation of your computer using terminal**
Now that you have open terminal you will see a black screen waiting for commands. First we need to know where in the computer we are located:

pwd= print working directory, now we know our location in the computer

```
pwd
```

The default location after you have open terminal is your `home` directory 

We can list the contents of the directory by typing

```
ls
```
